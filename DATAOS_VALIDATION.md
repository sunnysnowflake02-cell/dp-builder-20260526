# DataOS artifact validation (LLM)

**Overall:** PASS

## Join graph
All edges connect approved tables with valid join columns. Relationships are appropriately defined as many-to-one, and all joins are within the same schema.

## SQL / Lens YAML
All SQL references use load_sql(logical_name) correctly. Dimension types are valid and conform to the expected types: boolean, number, string, time.

## Consumer data product YAML
The consumer YAML references the lens name 'unified-supply-chain-dp' consistently and lists approved source FQNs sensibly.
